1)
JSON data is written in page so many times despite I had only 2 objects.
I added @JsonIgnore annotation to the head of @ManyToOne relation in my model class to resolve this.

2)
I was using @Controller for my controller class but when I wanted to send pure data, I got error.
This problem was resolved when I replaced @Controller with @RestController.

3)
When I used 
Stream.of("sa napyon", "as iyi sen").forEach(text ->{
	Message message = new Message(text);
	message.setSender(user);
	user.getMessages().add(message);
	userRepository.save(user);
	messageRepository.save(message);
});
the messageRepository had 3 messages (2nd message is recorded twice) instead of 2.
Because I had
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "sender", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
private Set<Message> messages = new HashSet<>();
"If you have a cascade ALL type then you dont need to save your child entity first, just the parent."
